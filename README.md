# Goodreads Dark (Jade) theme
This is a dark theme for the [goodreads.com](https://www.goodreads.com) website. This custom userstyle follows [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS) guidelines.

**Too green?**
Try the [-Zero saturation version](#dark-jade-zero-saturation). It keeps the accent colors the same but zeros out the saturation on the backgrounds making it more grey.

## Notes
Why is it so green?
The color scheme was inspired by Jade City. Here's why,
1. Goodreads.com default link color is `hsl(176, 100%, 19%)`
![Goodreads.com default link color](images/og-jade_default-gr-link.png)
2. I read [Jade City by Fonda Lee](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34606064-jade-city) right before creating this.
3. What can I say? I had jade on my mind.

### Bigger project than anticipated
This turned out to be a **HUGE** undertaking. It definitely was the hardest I have tackled thus far. Holy mackrel, why is goodreads so against reusing styles?

I also took liberties with the some aesthetics.
- The removal of many borders.
- Increased some padding here and there.
- Rounded out some corners.
