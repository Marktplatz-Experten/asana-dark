## Notes

### Jade City inspired color scheme
Color scheme inspired from Jade City by Fonda Lee. With Goodreads.com default link color as `hsl(176, 100%, 19%)`, I could not resist.

### Bigger project than anticipated
This turned out to be a **HUGE** undertaking. It definitely was the hardest I have tackled thus far. Holy mackrel, why is goodreads so against reusing styles?

I also took liberties with the some aesthetics.
- The removal of many borders.
- Increased some padding here and there.
- Rounded out some corners.
